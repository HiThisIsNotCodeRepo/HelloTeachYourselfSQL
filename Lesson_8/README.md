*Understanding Functions*

In fact, very few functions are supported identically by all major DBMSs. Although all types of functionality are
usually available in each DBMS, the function name or syntax can differ greatly.

*Function categories*

1. Text function.
    1. `LEFT()`,`LENGTH()`,`LOWER()`,`LTRIM()`,`RIGHT()`,`RTRIM()`,`SOUNDEX()`,`UPPER()`.

       alphanumeric pattern describing the phonetic representation of the text.
2. Numeric functions
    1. `ABS()`,`COS()`,`EXP()`,`PI()`,`SIN()`,`SQRT()`,`TAN()`
3. Date and time functions.
